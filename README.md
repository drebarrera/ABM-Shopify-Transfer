# ABM-Shopify-Transfer
The ABM Shopify Transfer was a project contribution I made to the store transfer of RejuveMD's DermPro store to Shopify. In partnership with Aesthetic Brand Marketing (ABM), I developed a Basic program used to scan a Shopify webpage and populate an csv file with the content of desired website content. The final product was used to efficiently transfer 55 pages of DermPro store content without any help from the DermPro website building company itself. ABM was grateful for my contribution, as it saved their team many hours of copy/pasting content.

Contents:
1. crawl.bas - VBA Basic file responsible for crawling DermPro webpages and finding HTML content.
2. Barrera-Store-CSV.csv - CSV file of website content generated by crawl.bas.
3. store-processing.py - Processing of CSV content in order to produce final data. Processing was used to produce lemmatized keywords for entries generated by the crawl.bas program.
